# Klevebrand Skywire Framework
This repository is a framework that abstracts away the complicated parts to send network requests from a raw Skywire modem and make it easy to integrate 4g network in robotics and IoT devices.

# Overview 
The aim of this project is to create a high performance and fast HTTP and TCP client wapper for a Skywire modem. That can be used in robotics and IoT devices, to move away certain logic and control from the robot or device itself, and instead handle actions on a bigger server instead.

# Vision
My vision is to create simple solutions, things donâ€™t need to be harder than they need to be.

# Klevebrand Skywire Framework
This repository is a framework that abstracts away the complicated parts to send network requests from a raw Skywire modem and make it easy to integrate 4g network in robotics and IoT devices.

# Overview 
The aim of this project is to develop a high-performance HTTP and TCP client wrapper for a Skywire modem, designed for use in robotics and IoT devices.

# Vision
My vision is to create simple solutions, things donâ€™t need to be harder than they need to be.
